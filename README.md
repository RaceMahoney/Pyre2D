# Pyre2D
A two-dimensinal platfromer in Unity 2017 to be used an testing environment for my senior research project. The project aims to determine if using capture replay and image diffrencing can accurately detect software bugs for games in regression testing. 

## Usage 
While this game is not fully developed as of yet, you may examine important elements of the game such as the C# scripts written for the functionality of the game. These can be found under "Assets" -> "MyScripts".
